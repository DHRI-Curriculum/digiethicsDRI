# Levels of impact  

This workshop follows an approach that encourages scholars to think critically about key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) at every stage of project or research design and implementation.  Most importantly, this workshop aims to emphasize how a scholar's project or research may directly or indirectly affect real **people** in potentially harmful ways, in order to attempt to avoid causing people such harm. 

## "Do the right thing"  

> Ethics can be thus considered a matter of methods. **“Doing the right thing” is an everyday activity**, as we make multiple choices about how we might act. Our decisions and actions transform into habits, norms, and rules over time and repetition. Our choices carry consequences. **As researchers, we carry more responsibility** than users of social media platforms. Why? Because we hold more cards when we present findings of studies and make knowledge statements intended to present some truth -big or little T- about the world to others. (Annette Markham, ["OKCupid data release fiasco: It’s time to rethink ethics education,"](http://annettemarkham.com/2016/05/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-its-time-to-rethink-ethics-education/) 2016)

## Thinking in terms of "levels of impact"

> At the most basic **level of an impact** approach, we might ask how our methods of data collection **impact humans, directly.** If one is interviewing, or the data is visibly connected to a person, this is easy to see. But a distance principle might help us recognize that when the data is very distant from where it originated, it can seem disconnected from persons, or what some regulators call ‘human subjects.’ At another level, we can ask how our methods of organizing data, analytical interpretations, or findings as shared datasets are being used — or might be used — **to build definitional categories or to profile particular groups** in ways that could impact livelihoods or lives. Are we contributing positive or negative categorizations? At a third level of impact, we can consider **the social, economic, or political changes caused** by one’s research processes or products, in both the short and long term. These three levels raise different questions than those typically raised by ethics guidelines and regulations. This is because an impact approach is targeted toward the possible or probable impact, rather than the prevention of impact in the first place. It acknowledges that we change the world as we conduct even the smallest of scientific studies, and therefore, we must take some personal responsibility for our methods.

1. Direct impacts on people
2. Ramifications of (re)producing categories
3. Social, political and economic effects

Note that the workshop will further address these levels of impact, and the issue of range of impact, in more depth later.    

## Activity: Think, Pair, Share  

* Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 
* Now, describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the *design* of your project.  
* What human labor is required to do it?  
* Do you need to collect data? From where or who? 
* Would there be any consequences if someone else got a hold of that data?  

* Next, describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the *purpose* of your project.
* It a tool that will organize data?  
* Will it produce new knowledge?  
* Who can access it?  

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.

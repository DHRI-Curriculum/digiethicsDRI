# Ethics beyond compliance

As mentioned at the beginning of this workshop:  

The approach of this workshop is premised on the understanding that there is no simple roadmap for practicing 'good ethics' and, indeed, what constitutes 'good' or 'ethical' for one individual may vary from the next and often is a reflective of a scholar's political commitments and personal background.  Nonetheless, this workshop will foreground key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) when designing and doing digital projects or digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.   

To do so - I would argue - requires thinking beyond just the institutional requirements posed by the IRB.  

## Activity 1: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

1. Describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the *design* of your project.  
* What human labor is required to do it?  
* Do you need to collect data? From where or who? 
* Would there be any consequences if someone else got a hold of that data?  

2. Next, describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the *purpose* of your project.
* It a tool that will organize data?  
* Will it produce new knowledge?  
* Who can access it?  

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.

# Ethics beyond compliance

As mentioned at the beginning of this workshop, there is no simple roadmap for practicing 'good ethics' and, indeed, what constitutes 'good' or "ethical" for one individual may vary from the next and often is reflective of a scholar's political commitments and personal background. Nonetheless, this workshop will foreground key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) when designing and doing digital projects or digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.

To do so, I would argue, requires thinking beyond just the institutional requirements stipulated by the IRB, or formal methods (e.g.: [Darren Abramson and Lee Pike, "When Formal Systems Kill: Computer Ethics and Formal Methods," 2011](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lepike/pubs/fm-ethics.pdf)).

## Activity  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on.  

1. Describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project: what does it aim to *do*?  
2. Next, describe in 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the design of your project: *how* will you do this?  
3. In relation to the project's purpose and design, what might be some ethical concerns that fall beyond questions of legality or the purview of the IRB?  

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.

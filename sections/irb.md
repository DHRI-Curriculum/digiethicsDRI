# Institutional Review Board (IRB)   

The policies and principals stipulated in the Belmont Report largely inform those of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  

Every university or research institution should have its own or an affiliated IRB, which provides oversight, administrative support, and educational training to ensure that research done at that location complies with federal and state regulations, and university or institutional policy.  

## When is IRB review required?  

Usually, IRB review is required when *ALL* of the criteria below are met:  

1. The investigator is conducting research or clinical investigation,
2. The proposed research or clinical investigation involves human subjects, and
3. Your university or research institution is engaged in the research or clinical investigation involving human subjects.

Who thinks they will need to apply for IRB approval?  

*Note: IRB protocols and procedures vary from institution to institution. Be sure to seek specific information from your home institution if you think there is a chance you may need IRB approval. That said, once your project is under their radar, you cannot undo their gaze onto it.*  

## So you think you may need IRB approval?  
 
Some advice:  

- Aim to submit your IRB application at least 3 months prior to the start date of your research (often times, the applicant will need to submit multiple revisions thereafter)
- Make sure you have completed any necessary exams or trainings-for example, universities often make it a requirement to pass an exam through the [Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI program)](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/mission-and-history/)
- Keep in mind that the IRB usually requires you to attach all grant proposals (if applicable) that fund the project.
- Sharing photos, videos, or audio files of people to a public website or another publicly accessible space/repository as part of your research? You will need all participants to sign a legal deed of gift (an example [here](http://libraries.uky.edu/user_uploads/372_NunnCenter-Release-Master-2017v5.pdf), specific to oral history projects)

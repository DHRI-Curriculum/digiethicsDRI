# Institutional Review Board (IRB) at CUNY  

The policies and principals stipulated in the Belmont Report largely inform those of the IRB.  

The [CUNY Human Research Protection Program (HRPP)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Administrative-Services/Human-Subjects-Research-Protection-Program-(HRPP)) 

> “The program provides oversight, administrative support and educational training to ensure that CUNY research complies with federal and State regulations, University policy and the highest ethical standards... The CUNY HRPP comprises of 5 University Integrated Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and 19 on-site HRPP offices.”

## When is CUNY HRPP or IRB review required?  

When *ALL* of the criteria below are met:  
1. The investigator is conducting research or clinical investigation;  
2. The proposed research or clinical investigation involves human subjects; AND  
3. CUNY is engaged in the research or clinical investigation involving human subjects.  

*Consult your advisor and comittee members for advice on if you may need to apply.*

## So you think you may need CUNY HRPP or IRB approval?  
 
Some advice:  
* Aim to submit IRB application at least 3 months prior to the start date of your research  
* Note that your CUNY IRB application will be conducted through the home CUNY campus of your advisor - automatically linked when you start the application on the Ideate website
* Be patient with the Ideate website... and use Firefox as your browser - more Ideate tips [here](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/GC%20HRPP%20Documents/Ideate%20Help%20Docs/IDEATE-QUICK-TIPS-and-TROUBLESHOOTING-vNov17.pdf?ext=.pdf)  
* Make sure you have completed the CITI exam - more info [here](http://www2.cuny.edu/research/research-compliance/training-education/citi-training/)  
* Keep in mind that IRB requires you attach all grant proposals (if applicable) that fund the project - *if not too late, keep this in mind when writing those grant proposals*

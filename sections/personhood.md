## Activity - Case example: “The Science of ‘Gaydar’”   

Review Joshua Tabak and Vivian Zayas's [academic article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036671) and [their summary of it for the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/opinion/sunday/the-science-of-gaydar.html), and discuss:

* What kinds of “human subjects” are involved in this study?

* Is a social media photo of oneself an extension of the self? 

* Does their methodology raise any ethical concerns?

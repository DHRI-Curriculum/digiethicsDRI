# The question of personhood

> “Is an avatar a person?” (AoIR)  

> “Is one’s digital information [e.g. photos, videos, audio, social media posts] an extension of the self?” (AoIR) 

> "Can we assume a person is wholly removed from large data pools?" *Note: "there is considerable evidence that even ‘anonymised’
datasets that contain enough personal information can result in individuals being identifiable"* (AoIR). 

> "Does the connection between one’s online data and [their] physical person enable psychological, economic, or physical, harm?" (AoIR)

## Activity: Discuss a case example   

Review Joshua Tabak and Vivian Zayas's [academic article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036671) and [their summary of it for the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/opinion/sunday/the-science-of-gaydar.html), and discuss:

* What kinds of “human subjects” are involved in this study? If yes, did they participate with informed consent?
* What is the study's main data set?  
* Does their methodology raise any ethical concerns?

## Activity: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Does your project collect data from human subjects? Or digital information that may be an extension of the self?
* Do you plan to conduct informed consent with such human subjects?  
* Would it be harmful if others could access this data? If yes, do you have a plan in place to anonymize and/or further protect the data, including on cloud and other data storage platforms? Are the benefits worth the risk - for who, respectively?   

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.  

# Pause. 

Update our shared guidelines:

* What are "levels of impact"?  
* What is the "distance principle"?
* What ethical concerns did we address regarding: 
	public vs. private data, and 
	data(text) vs. persons?

# Review  

## Workshop debrief

By the end of this workshop, participants have:

* Reviewed ethical practices to satisfy institutional needs (IRB) when working with "human subjects."
* Learned specific ethical questions and levels of impact to consider when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools.
* Engaged with alternative approaches and case examples.
* Envisioned the ethics of their own projects and methodologies.

## Next steps 

### Determine institutional requirements

- Why was IRB review instituted?
- Will you apply for IRB?

### Explore ethics beyond compliance

- What are the three levels of impact that we discussed?
- What does range of impact refer to?
- Which will you consider?

### Reassess your research methodology

- How will the above affect your research/project methods and design?
- Is your research free and open or proprietary?
- Is your research accessible?

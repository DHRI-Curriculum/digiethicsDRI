# Review  

## Workshop debrief

By the end of this workshop, participants have:  
* Reviewed ethical practices to satisfy institutional needs (IRB) when working with "human subjects";
* Learned specific ethical questions and levels of impact to consider when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools;
* Engaged with alternative approaches and case examples; and
* Envisioned the ethics of their own projects and methodologies.  

## Next steps 

{Determine institutional requirements}  
Will you apply for IRB?  

{Explore ethics beyond compliance}  
What are the three levels of impact that we discussed?  
What does range of impact refer to?  
Which will you consider?  

{Reassess your research methodology}  
How will the above affect your research/project methods and design?

![graphic of two words - knowledge and power - and semi-circular arrows from power to knowledge and from knowledge to power, forming a circle](power.png)

Some key terms:
* **Hegemony** (Antonio Gramsci)
* **Discourse** (Michel Foucault)
* **"Policing the crisis"** (Stuart Hall)

## Discuss

* *BRIEFLY,* how are knowledge and power mutually constituted, according to the theorizations of Gramsci, Hall or Foucault?
* What do the above key terms mean?  
* How might we apply these concepts when thinking through ethics for digital research and projects?  

## Ramifications of (re)producing categories

Decisions on the categories & boundaries we use shape our:

* Datasets
* Algorithms
* Maps

## Activity
 
What is an example of a category or boundary you have to establish when making a dataset? Algorithm? map?

*â€¦ (re)producing definitional categories in our projects may have political or economic effects!*

# Levels of impact  

This workshop follows an approach that encourages scholars to think critically about key ethical questions to ask (and keep asking!) at every stage of project or research design and implementation.  Most importantly, this workshop aims to emphasize how a scholar's project or research may directly or indirectly affect real **people** in potentially harmful ways, in order to attempt to avoid causing people such harm. 

## "Do the right thing"  

> "Ethics can be thus considered a matter of methods. **“Doing the right thing” is an everyday activity**, as we make multiple choices about how we might act. Our decisions and actions transform into habits, norms, and rules over time and repetition. Our choices carry consequences. **As researchers, we carry more responsibility** than users of social media platforms. Why? Because we hold more cards when we present findings of studies and make knowledge statements intended to present some truth -big or little T- about the world to others."

# Levels of impact  

This workshop aims to emphasize how a scholar's project or research may directly or indirectly affect real **people** in potentially harmful ways, in order to attempt to avoid causing people such harm.  

> Ethics can be thus considered a matter of methods. **“Doing the right thing” is an everyday activity**, as we make multiple choices about how we might act. Our decisions and actions transform into habits, norms, and rules over time and repetition. Our choices carry consequences. **As researchers, we carry more responsibility** than users of social media platforms. Why? Because we hold more cards when we present findings of studies and make knowledge statements intended to present some truth -big or little T- about the world to others.

## Thinking in terms of "levels of impact"

> ... an impact approach is targeted toward the possible or probable impact, rather than the prevention of impact in the first place. It acknowledges that we change the world as we conduct even the smallest of scientific studies, and therefore, we must take some personal responsibility for our methods.

This workshop, drawing from Markham 2016, will focus on three levels of impact:  
1. Direct impacts on people
2. Ramifications of (re)producing categories
3. Social, political and economic effects  

Additionally, this workshop will address the range of impact:  
-- Accessibility to your work - in terms of cost and languages and for people with physical disabilities

# Range of Impact: Accessibility to Your Work

## What is accessibility?  

Accessibility refers to:
> The quality or condition of being accessible (in various senses).

And access refers to:
> Able to be received, acquired, or made use of; open or available.

## What forms of accessibility are particularly relevant to consider when designing, doing, and sharing digital research and projects?  

### Accessibility to people with disabilities

Questions to consider:
* is your project accessible to people with visual, hearing, or other physical impairments?  
* if your project exists in a physical space, is that space accessible to people with various disabilities?
* is your project accessible in a variety of formats - e.g. are all images or audio clips paired with a text description? if your project is online, does that site function with a screen reader?

### International accessibility and language access

Quesitons to consider:
* is your project accessible from outside of the country where you made it?  
* are there particular language-speaking audiences that may find your project useful or pertinent? is your project accessible in the language(s) that they speak?
* if yes, did a person create the translations or an automated service? do you have a method for quality control?

### Cost and proprietary accessibility

Questions to consider:
* is your project behind a paywall? or only accessible through propriety software or specific expensive hardware (e.g. Mac computers)?
* if your project exists online, does it require large bandwidth to open? 
* is your project open access? open source? 
* is your project licensed for sharing through [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)?
* would you consider creating an Open Educational Resource (OER)?
* would you consider making any data related to your project publicly accessible? (and would this raise any anonymity, confidentiality or other ethical concerns?)

## What or when *NOT* to make things accessible  

Thinking of accessibility here in terms of making tools, projects, writing, or data readily available for re-use without having to first directly request permission, when might researchers or makers *not* want to make their work or data fully open and accessible? 

> I have increasingly come to wonder if “permission-less-ness” as many in “open” movements have theorized this, is built on some unexamined exploitation and extraction of labor – on invisible work, on unvalued work. Whose digital utopia does “openness” represent? ([Audrey Watters, "Invisible Labor and Digital Utopias," 2018](http://hackeducation.com/2018/05/04/cuny-labor-open))  

> Guard against the re-identification of your data. Practice ethical data sharing ([Matthew Zook et al, "Ten simple rules for responsible big data research," 2017](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005399))  

When might researchers or makers decide *not* to even record data or media, or to delete?    

> Just because we can record everything doesn’t mean that we as scholars must or should record everything... At some level, all forms of recording (writing, audio, video, photo) must be evaluated for how they distribute burdens of risk and objectification. ([Roshanak Kheshti, interviewed by Kelsey Chatlosh, "Interview: Sound recording, oral positionality, and audio as ethnographic object," 2018](http://parameters.ssrc.org/2018/04/interview-sound-recording-oral-positionality-and-audio-as-ethnographic-object/))

## Activity 5: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Who will be able to access your research or project? 
* Where and through what mediums will it be accessible?  
* Will it cost money to access?  
* Will it be accessible in different languages?  
* Will it be accessible to people who with visual, hearing, or other phsyical impairments?    

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.

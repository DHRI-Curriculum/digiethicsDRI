# Range of Impact  

## Accessibility to your work  

Some questions to consider:  

* Why use or produce open source tools? Or [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/) materials?

* Have you considered issues of digital accessibility for differently abled or language-speaking individuals? *For the latter group, beware of Google translate...*  

Some sources to check out:

* [Samir Chopra and Scott Dexter, *Decoding Liberation: The Promise of Free and Open Source Software*, 2007](http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~bcfoss/DL/)  
* [Dr. Joshua Mieleâ€™s](http://www.ski.org/users/joshua-miele) work on digital accessibility - see a review of his GC talk by Nanyamkah Mars [here](http://dh.prattsils.org/blog/resources/event-reviews/digital-accessibility-and-the-making-of-a-meta-maker-movement-a-talk-by-dr-joshua-miele-hosted-by-gc-digital-initiatives-at-the-graduate-center-cuny-on-thursday-october-20-2016/)

## Activity: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Who will be able to access your research or project? Where will it be accessible?  
* Will it cost money to access?  
* Will it be accesible in different languages?  
* Will it be accesible to the visually, hearing or otherwise physically impaired?    

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.

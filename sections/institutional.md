# Starting with ethics from the standpoint of the institution

But as scholars, first things first:
Understanding any institutional compliance requirements you may need to fullfil to be permitted to do your project or research (for those based at an institution in the United States)  

So, before delving into a deeper discussion of ethics beyond compliance, this first section of the workshop will address:  

* The Belmont Report and Institutional Review Board (IRB) - a brief history and their intentions *their core principals may be useful to think through even if you are free to skip the logistical hassle of applying for IRB!*    
* How to know if you will need to get IRB approval
* CUNY centers and resources

*Note: This first section on institutional ethics is more focused on digital research (rather than making tools or other projects) - but the latter section on ethics beyond compliance touches upon issues concerning researching and tool-building as well.*

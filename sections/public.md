# “Public” data

> “In an age of digital media, do we really have any privacy?” ([Susan Barnes, “A Privacy Paradox” (2006)](http://firstmonday.org/article/view/1394/1312))

How do we delineate between "research" vs. "spying"?  Does this change when the project focuses on "big data"? (see [Berendt, Büchler, & Rockwell, “Is it Research or is it Spying? Thinking-Through Ethics in Big Data AI and Other Knowledge Sciences” (2015)](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt/Papers/berendt_buechler_rockwell_KUIN_2015.pdf))

What forms of "public" data are ethical to use? Or require attribution? 

How might we (inadvertently) share data?

## Activity: Discuss a case example

Read [this brief article](https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-happens-when-scientists-study-black-twitter-1630540515) about a USC Study on “Black Twitter” and discuss:

* Does this project involve “human subjects”?  
* Are Tweets “public” data?  
* In reference to the article, why did this project invoke such controversy? Do you agree with the article?

*Note that USC has removed the study from its website, otherwise we would also examine its site directly.*

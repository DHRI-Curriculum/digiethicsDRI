# Glossary  

*The Belmont Report*—published by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1979, the Belmont Report ""identifies basic ethical principles and guidelines that address ethical issues arising from the conduct of research with human subjects" (source: [HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html); see [The Belmont Report](belmont.md) section)  

*beneficience*—a core principe in *the Belmont Report* that stipulates that researchers should "(1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms." A key concern when applying this principle is an *assessment of risks and benefits* (source: [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html#xbasic); see [The Belmont Report](belmont.md) section)  

*consent*—

*ethics*—the moral principles that an individual aims to follow in practice to the best of their ability, research, and foresight ((see the [Introduction](introduction/md))  

*The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research*—a commission created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, "charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles" (source: [HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html); see [The Belmont Report](belmont.md) section)

*personhood*—

*respect for persons*—a core principle in *the Belmont Report* that stipulates that "individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection." A key concern when applying this principle is *informed consent* (source: [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html#xbasic); see [The Belmont Report](belmont.md) section)  

*situated ethics*—situated ethics refers to the notion that a person's understandings of and commitments to ethics or morality are greatly linked to their own experiences, positionalities, and political orientations. Note that this understanding of "situated ethics" is an application of Donna Haraway's idea of "situated knowledges" (1988) to the arena of ethical perspectives (see the [Introduction](introduction/md))

# Belmont Report 

The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, published the Belmont Report in 1979.   

Some things that prompted this:      

* [Tuskegee Syphillis Study (1932-1972)](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/index.html)  
* [Nuremberg Code (1948)](https://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/nuremberg.pdf)  
* [Declaration of Helsinki (1964)](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/)   

The Comission:
> was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles.  

The Belmont Report:
> identifies basic ethical principles and guidelines that address ethical issues arising from the conduct of research with human subjects.

## 3 core principles:  

* Respect for persons
* Beneficence
* Justice

## Key concerns when applying the 3 principles:

1. **Informed consent**
	* Information, not deception
	* Comprehension
	* Voluntariness & right to withdraw  

2. **Assessment of risks and benefits**
	* The nature and scope of risks and benefits - always minimize risk of harm!
		* E.g. question of anonymity
	* The systematic assessment of risks and benefits  

3. **Selection of subjects**
	* Fair recruitment and selection

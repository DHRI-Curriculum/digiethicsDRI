# Additional case examples to consider

This section includes various case examples of digital projects and research that participants may look into and discuss in relation to the ethical questions and concepts addressed, time-permitting.  

## Ex. 1: USC Study on “Black Twitter”

Read [this brief article](https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-happens-when-scientists-study-black-twitter-1630540515) and discuss:

* Does this project involve “human subjects”?  
* Are Tweets “public” data?  
* In reference to the article, why did this project invoke such controversy? Do you agree with the article?

*Note that USC has removed the study from its website, otherwise we would also examine its site directly too.*

## Ex. 2: Interference Archive (IA) 

Check out [their website](http://interferencearchive.org/), read [this brief article](http://technical.ly/brooklyn/2016/11/28/interference-archive-activism-jen-hoyer/%20) and discuss:

* What kinds of materials does IA host and do they have rights to it?
* In reference to the article, how does IA see itself as “resisting the hierarchy”?
* What levels of impact does IA aim to take into account?

*Fun fact: I helped paint that #NoDAPL banner - with others at [Decolonize this Place](http://www.decolonizethisplace.org/) - shown in the article's first photo.*

* Relatedly, might public syllabi projects - e.g. the [#StandingRockSyllabus](https://nycstandswithstandingrock.wordpress.com/standingrocksyllabus/) - also be understood as "resisting the hierarchy"? What are some other project examples that attempt this?

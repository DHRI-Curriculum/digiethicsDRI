![big dollar sign $](images/dollar.png)  

> "At a third level of impact, we can consider **the social, economic, or political changes caused** by one’s research processes or products, in both the short and long term." (Annette Markham, ["OKCupid data release fiasco: It’s time to rethink ethics education,"](http://annettemarkham.com/2016/05/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-its-time-to-rethink-ethics-education/) 2016, emphasis added)  

Some questions to consider:

* Whose **labor** and what **materials** are used to make the digital tools you use?
* Could your research or project be used to justify or facilitate **state control** or **surveillance**?  
* Could it influence **social or political discourse**? Modes of **profit**?

## Activity: Discuss a case example

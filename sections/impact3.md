# Level of Impact #3

## Social, political and economic impacts  

> At a third level of impact, we can consider **the social, economic, or political changes caused** by one’s research processes or products, in both the short and long term. ([Annette Markham, "OKCupid data release fiasco: It’s time to rethink ethics education," 2016](http://annettemarkham.com/2016/05/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-its-time-to-rethink-ethics-education/), emphasis added)  

Some questions to consider:

* Whose **labor** and what **materials** are used to make the digital tools you use?  
* Could your research or project be used to justify or facilitate potentially harmful **control** or **surveillance**?    
* Could it influence **social or political discourse**? Modes of **profit**?

## Activity   

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Whose labor and what materials do you rely upon to do your work?  
* Could your research or project be used to justify or facilitate potentially harmful control or surveillance - by e.g. the state, a vigilante group, an abusive partner?  
* How could your work cause changes to or justify social, economic or political discourses?  
* Will your work be used for profit, for who?

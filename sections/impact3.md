# Level of Impact #3

## Social, political and economic impacts

![big dollar sign $](images/dollar.png)  

> "At a third level of impact, we can consider **the social, economic, or political changes caused** by one’s research processes or products, in both the short and long term." (Annette Markham, ["OKCupid data release fiasco: It’s time to rethink ethics education,"](http://annettemarkham.com/2016/05/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-its-time-to-rethink-ethics-education/) 2016, emphasis added)  

Some questions to consider:

* Whose **labor** and what **materials** are used to make the digital tools you use?  
* Could your research or project be used to justify or facilitate potentially harmful **control** or **surveillance**?  
* Could it influence **social or political discourse**? Modes of **profit**?  

## Activity: Discuss a case example  

Check out [the Gender API's website](https://gender-api.com/) and click around its various sections to read about how the API works, and discuss:

* What kinds of information is this API producing?
* Who might be the users of this API? What may be their intentions in using this API?
* Does the use of this API raise any ethical concerns? 

## Activity: Think, Pair, Share  

Think about the digital project or research you are or will be working on. 

* Whose labor and what materials do you rely upon to do your work?  
* Could your research or project be used to justify or facilitate potentially harmful control or surveillance - by e.g. the state, a vigilante group, an abusive partner?  
* How could your work cause changes to or justify social, economic or political discourses?  
* Will your work be used for profit, for who?  

Pair up with another person near you and discuss. Share as a class.  

# Pause. 

Update our shared guidelines:

* What is the third level of impact? 
* Additional examples of this?

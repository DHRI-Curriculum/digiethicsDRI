## Your digital work

Ethical concerns vary between people, disciplines, projects and tools. 

Introduce yourself to the person next to you:
* Name
* Program
* Current or upcoming digital research or projects? 
* Digital tools that you use?
* Ethical concerns?

Then introduce that person to the group.

## Workshop goals

We will:
* **consider** ethical practices to satisfy institutional needs (IRB) and working with “human subjects,”
* **create** a working set of guidelines for ethical research,
* **explore** ethical questions when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools,
* **discuss** the ethics of example projects and methodologies,
* **envision and elaborate** on our own ideas and concerns!

*Note: We will create the aforementioned working set of guidelines in a shared google doc. The workshop leader will create the google doc and share its link with participants. Each participant may add to the doc and write their name or alias down as a contributor, or choose to opt out. This doc will be a space for us throughout this workshop to share notes and additional resources.*

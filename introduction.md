# Introduction

## What are ethics?

> n. Moral principles, or a system of these.
	~Oxford English Dictionary Online

## What do we mean by digital projects and research?

Projects or research that engages with the digital - i.e. that examines, uses or creates digital tools or platforms.  

## Situated ethics  

"Situated" ethics - drawing from Donna Haraway, "Situated Knowledges," 1988 - refers to the notion that: 
A person's understandings of and commitments to ethics or morality are greatly linked to their own experiences, positionalities, and political orientations 

> "I would like to insist on the embodied nature of all vision, and so reclaim the sensory system that has been used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere. This is the gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation. This gaze signifies the unmarked positions of Man and White, one of the many nasty tones of the word objectivity to feminist ears in scientific and technological, late industrial, militarized, racist and male dominant societies, that is, here, in the belly of the monster, in the United States in the late 1980s. I would like a doctrine of embodied objectivity  that accommodates paradoxical and critical feminist science projects: feminist objectivity means quite simply situated knowledges." (Haraway 1988: 581)  

## Introductions to each other

So, if ethics are situated, ethical concerns vary between people, disciplines, projects and tools.

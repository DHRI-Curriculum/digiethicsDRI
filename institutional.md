# Starting with ethics from the standpoint of the institution

We’ll organize our review of guidelines around the following steps:

* Institutional ethics 
* AND ethics beyond compliance

THEN:

* Questions / case examples
* Assess / Share results. 

Messy categories, and we’ll discuss why.

*Note: This first section on institutional ethics is more focused on digital research (rather than making tools or other projects) - but the latter section on ethics beyond compliance touches upon issues concerning researching and tool-building as well.*

## Belmont Report 

National Research Act of 1974 
Est. the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research

**3 core principles:**
* Respect for persons
* Beneficence
* Justice

Key concerns when applying the 3 principles:

1. **Informed consent**
	* Information, not deception
	* Comprehension
	* Voluntariness & right to withdraw
2. **Assessment of risks and benefits**
	* The nature and scope of risks and benefits - always minimize risk of harm!
		* E.g. question of anonymity
	* The systematic assessment of risks and benefits
3. **Selection of subjects**
	* Fair recruitment and selection

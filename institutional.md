# Starting with ethics from the standpoint of the institution

We’ll organize our review of guidelines around the following steps:

* Institutional ethics 
* AND ethics beyond compliance

THEN:

* Questions / case examples
* Assess / Share results. 

Messy categories, and we’ll discuss why.

*Note: This first section on institutional ethics is more focused on digital research (rather than making tools or other projects) - but the latter section on ethics beyond compliance touches upon issues concerning researching and tool-building as well.*

# Starting with ethics from the standpoint of the institution

But as scholars, first things first:
Understanding any institutional compliance requirements you may need to fullfil to do your project or research

So, before delving into a deeper discussion of ethics beyond compliance, this next section of the workshop will address:
* The Belmont Report and Instituional Review Board (IRB) - a brief history and their intentions *their core principals may be useful to think through even if you are free to skip the logistical hassle of applying for IRB!*    
* How to know if you will need to get IRB approval
* CUNY centers and resources 

*Note: This first section on institutional ethics is more focused on digital research (rather than making tools or other projects) - but the latter section on ethics beyond compliance touches upon issues concerning researching and tool-building as well.*

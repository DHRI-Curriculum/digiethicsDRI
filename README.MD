# Ethics for Digital Projects and Research 

Launching a digital project or doing research on digital platforms or with digital forms of data bring to the fore unique ethical concerns that often extend beyond the purview of a scholar's home university's Institutional Review Board.  This discussion-based workshop will address an array of ethical questions and concerns for folks doing digital projects or research with an emphasis on consent, personhood, confidentiality, political economy, the politics of knowledge production, and accessibility. In addressing these issues, this workshop will first provide a general overview of ethics for institutional research compliance - including the Belmont Report and Institutional Review Board - and then delve into an array of ethical issues that extend beyond compliance that may arise specifically when doing digital prjoects or research. The approach of this workshop is premised on the understanding that there is no simple roadmap for practicing 'good ethics' and, indeed, what constitutes 'good' or 'ethical' for one individual may vary from the next and often is a reflective of a scholar's political commitments and personal background.  Nonetheless, this workshop will foreground key ethical questions to ask when designing and implementing a digital project or form of digital research, and key concepts to draw upon when thinking through these questions.

### In this workshop, we (workshop participants) will:  

* **consider** ethical practices to satisfy institutional needs (IRB) and working with “human subjects,”
* **create** a working set of guidelines for ethical research,
* **explore** ethical questions when doing various forms of digital research and using digital tools,
* **discuss** the ethics of example projects and methodologies,
* **envision and elaborate** on our own ideas and concerns!  

*Note: We will create the aforementioned working set of guidelines in a shared google doc. The workshop leader will create the google doc and share its link with participants. Each participant may add to the doc and write their name or alias down as a contributor, or choose to opt out. This doc will be a space for us throughout this workshop to share notes and additional resources.*

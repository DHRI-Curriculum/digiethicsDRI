### Politics of knowledge production cont.  

#### An example:

The hegemonic racial discourses that associate Blackness with criminality in the United States serve to justify police brutality towards and higher rates of criminalization and mass incarceration of Black people - and these higher rates of policing and incarcerating serve to justify the assumption of their criminality.

So then when, for eample, someone attempts to make an algorithm to identify potential criminals that is produced through machine learning on crime data (e.g. the number of accused crimes in relation to demographic data) that algorithm will reproduce the racist ideologies and practices that police and incarcerate Black people at a much higher rate - an example we will discuss more later.

#### Another example:

![A comic from Postcolonial #DH No. 28 by Adeline Koh: "Wikepedia and the politics of gender categorization" - A bunch of white men stand to the left behind a roped off area, and a bunch of people of color and women stand to the right. A white male facing the people to the right says to them, "I'm sorry, there just isn't any more space in the main wikipedia 'American Novelist' category. Maybe you oculd join the 'American Woman Novelist' category?"](wiki.png)

Categories are key to digital tools in many ways - the organizational systems used by libraries and archives, the tags used on websites, the methods of categorization informing algorithms - which then shapes not only how things/people/etc are grouped together but what is searchable and findable, and the trajectory of canon formation and what is cited and foregrounded.

... What might be another example of how knowledge is politicized in a digital project?

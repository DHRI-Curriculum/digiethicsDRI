# Debrief

## Developing our own ethical digital research

Review the collective guidelines we have created so far and any additional notes you jotted down, and make a few notes by yourself about the questions listed below. 

> {determine institutional requirements}  
 will you apply for IRB? 

> {explore more radical ethics}  
what levels of impact will you consider?

> {reassess your research methodology}  
how will the above affect your research/project methods & design?

Discuss with your partner, and then share with the group!

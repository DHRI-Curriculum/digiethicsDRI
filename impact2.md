## Ramifications of (re)producing categories

Decisions on the categories & boundaries we use shape our:

Some key terms:
* **Hegemony** (Gramsci)
* **Discourse** (Foucault)
* **"Policing the crisis"** (Hall)

Discuss: 
* *BRIEFLY,* how are knowledge and power mutually constituted, according to the theorizations of Gramsci, Hall or Foucault?
* What do the above key terms mean?

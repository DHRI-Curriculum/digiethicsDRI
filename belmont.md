	* Comprehension
	* Voluntariness & right to withdraw
2. **Assessment of risks and benefits**
	* The nature and scope of risks and benefits - always minimize risk of harm!
		* E.g. question of anonymity
	* The systematic assessment of risks and benefits
3. **Selection of subjects**
	* Fair recruitment and selection
